Vibrational basis set
=====================

TROVE provides a number of basis set options for the vibrational basis functions. Currently, all these options are 1D basis sets. With an exception for the Harmonic and Morse bases, all basis set are generated numerically by solving some model 1D SchrÃ¶dinger equations. The solution methods can vary but are typically based either on the Numerov-Cooley method or variation method. The Numerov-Cooley method is a general shooting type method capable potentially dealing with 1D potentials of any complexity. The variational methods are used in conjunction with different basis sets (FBR) or even with DVR. in the following, the general basis set input is introduced with different basis options explained in detail.

Basis set block
---------------

The structure of the ``Basis`` set block in the TROVE input is best illustrated using a specific example. Here we use the XY\ :sub:'2' input as a typical example, such as SiH\ :sub:`2`:
::

    2,'numerov','linear', 'linear', range 0, 24, r 8, weight 1.0, points 1000,borders 10.0,160.0 deg
   END

1. Sub-groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basis functions are combined into sub-groups by their symmetry equivalence and labeled with using an integer label, with the vibrational modes numbers with 1,2,3,... and the rotational basis is referenced to as ``0``.

The first line (mode) is for the rotational basis set functions and used specify the value of  angular momentum :math:`J` and also in some cases the coverage of the rotational quantum number :math:`K`.  In this entry, ``JKtau`` is the type of the rotational basis set indicating the Wang symmetrisation of the type :math:`(-1)^{J+K+\tau}`, see [23Yurchenko]_, which is currently the only option in TROVE. For :math:`J>0` calculations the value of ``Jrot`` is changed to :math:`J` of interest.

Other cards of the mode 0 include ``KMAX`` (``Lmax``) defining the maximal value of the rotational QN :math:`k`. It is used for the quasi-linear triatomics where the rotational QN :math:`k` is constrained to the vibrational angular momentum quantum number :math:`l` as :math:`k=l`. Therefore, this card effectively defines  the range of the vibrational angular momentum for quasi-linear triatomics, :math:`l_{\rm max}`.



SiH\ :sub:`2` has :math:`3N - 6 = 3` internal degrees of freedom and thus 3 vibrational basis functions are required. For this example, the first group ``1`` combines the two stretches SiH` :sub:`1` and SiH\ :sub:`2` based on their symmetry equivalence: these two degrees of freedom transform through  each other when acted upon with the C\ :sub:`3v`(M) symmetry operations. The sub-group '2' is for the bending mode H-Si-H, which is a stand-alone degree of freedom that transforms independently from the sub-group 1. The grouping is used for producing symmetric combinations of basis functions and only coordinates symmetrically related should be grouped together. Details of this procedure are discussed in Chapter `Theory <https://spectrove.readthedocs.io/en/latest/theory.html>`__ and in [17YuYaOv]_.


2. Basis set method/type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a given vibrational basis function row, the options are as follows. The first card specifies what the one-dimensional basis functions are. In this example they are numerically generated using the Numerov-Cooley method (``Numerov`` card).

**Basis set options**

 - ``Numerov``: basis functions are generated numerically using the Numerov-Cooley method.
 - ``harmonic``: Analytic matrix elements or numerical values  of the harmonic oscillator wavefunctions are used.
 - ``morse``: basis functions and the corresponding matrix elements are based on the analytic expressions for the Morse polynomials.
 - ``Fourier``: this basis set is introduced for modes with periodicity in periodic potential functions.
 - ``laguerre-k``: is used in the direct connection with exact KEOs of triatomics, see sections about Frames.
 - ``sinrho-laguerre-k``: is another basis set constructed for specific exact KEOs of triatomics, see sections about Frames.


3. Coordinates used to expand KEO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This card specifies how the kinetic energy operator is expanded. For the general linearised KEO, the default option is ``linear`` which refers to the expansion in terms of the displacements :math:`\xi_i-\xi_i^{\rm eq}`. For exact KEOs, which are nor general and different for different systems, frames, coordinates,  this card defining the expansion types is usually associated with the KEO used.

Here are the currently available options in TROVE:

 - 'Rational': used for triatomic exact KEOs, which corresponds to the expansion of the stretching modes in terms of :math:`\frac{1}{r_i}` (1st "order"), :math:`\frac{1}{r_i}^2` (2nd "order") and :math:`\frac{1}{r_i r_j}` (mixed term).
 -  ``Automatic``: the KEO constructed as part of the input (under construction).
 - ``Bond-Length``: is similar to rational but independent for polyatomic molecules together with the ``Angle`` type. It has been used for the H\ :sub:`2`CS molecule [23MeOwTe]_.
 - ``Angle`` type is to expand the KEO in terms of the trigonometric combinations :math:`\cos(\alpha)` (1st order),  :math:`1/\tan(\alpha)` (2nd), :math:`1/\sin(\alpha)` (3rd), :math:`\sin(\alpha)` (4th), :math:`1/\tan(\alpha)^2` and :math:`1/\sin(\alpha)^2`, where :math:`\alpha` is a generic angle.
 - ``Dihedral`` is a part of the ``bond-length/angle/dihedral`` option; it is used to introduce the following terms in the KEO: :math:`\cos(\delta/2)` (1st), :math:`\sin(\delta/2)` (2nd), :math:`\cos(\delta/2)^2` (3rd), :math:`\cos(\delta/2)\sin(\delta/2)` (4th) and :math:`\sin(\delta/2)^2` (5th), where :math:`\delta` is a generic dihedral mode.


4. Coordinates used to expand PEF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The next card gives the expansion coordinates for the potential. The available options are

 - ``linear``, used for the displacement :math:`\xi_i-\xi_i^{\rm eq}`; a popular option for bending degrees of freedom.
 - ``morse``, used to represent the expansion in the form of the Morse coordinate :math:`1 - e^{-a (r-r_e)}` and a good option for the stretching coordinates.
 - ``cos(x)`` is to expand PEF in terms of :math:`\cos\alpha`, but can lead to singularities at around :math`\alpha=0` and :math`\alpha=\pi`.

5. Quantum number range
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The numbers after ``range`` specify the range of vibrational quantum numbers of the one-dimensional functions to be used.  For the example here, 0-12 is used for stretches and 0-24 for bends. The range should be consistent with the definition of the maximum polyad number used:

.. math::

     P_{\rm max} = \sum_i a_i v_i^{\rm max} \le n.

where :math:`a_i` are the polyd coefficients (weights), defined in the next card.

The ``borders`` card can be combined with the units cards, ``deg``, ``Degree``, ``Degrees``, ``Bohr``, for non-default units, e.g.
::

     2,'laguerre-k','linear','linear', range 0,24, weight 1.0, points 2000, borders  0.,120.0 deg


6. Polyad weights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The number after ``weight`` (aka ``resc``) gives the weighting :math:`a_i` of the vibrational quantum number for that coordinate in equation :math:`P_{\rm max} `.  Since the Si-H stretches here have a waiting of 2, it only makes sense to generate them from 0-12 if the polyad number is set to 24. The legacy aliases for ``weight`` are ``resc`` (resonance coefficients).

7-8. Integration points and borders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``points`` and   ``borders`` specify the number of points and the starting points for the Numerov-Cooley integration as the primary usage. Generating these one-dimensional functions is fast and so many points should be taken.  The borders should be set far enough into the classically forbidden region of the potential such that  the results are not sensitive to slightly larger or lower values. The units for ``borders`` are the same as those used that the potential was expanded in (Morse for stretches and angles in radians for bends in this example). For the Numerov-Cooley method, TROVE will check the numerical wavefunctions for their orthogonality and normalisation. If the latter properties are broken, TROVE will stop and suggest to increase the integration borders.

The second use of the coordinate grids defined by these tow cards is in the symmetrisation sampling procedure. Therefore these cards must be defined even for non Numerov-Cooley integration method.

The details of the primitive basis sets are given in the TROVE output file and will be discussed in Chapter `Outputs <https://spectrove.readthedocs.io/en/latest/output.html>`__.

Other non-standard options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 - ``Reduced`` (alias ``r``): this card allows to reduce the expansion order of PEF when used to generate the basis set. It is sometimes more efficient for symmetry purposes to use a quadratic-type expansion in place of the full expansion with the order defined by ``PotOrder``.
 - ``Periodic`` indicates that the potential is periodic and defines the periodicity. This property can be used to integrate the 1D problem on a smaller range and then extend by applying the periodic boundary conditions. Example:
 ::

     5,'fourier','linear', 'linear', range 0,17,  weight  1.0, points  500, borders,0.d0,720.d0 deg, periodic 2


 - ``Lvib`` (``Vib_Momentum``) is used for systems where the basis set is constructed by diagonalising the vibrational angular momentum :math:`\hat{l}^2`. The advantage of this construction scheme is that the basis set functions are assigned the vibrational angular momentum value :math:`l` and associated symmetry. This option is extensively used for the linear molecule C\ :sub:`2` H\ :sub:`2`, which is classified by irreps of D\ :sub:`nh` (M), e.g. :math:`E_{l}`, where :math:`l` is the vibrational angular momentum value.

 As another example, it an be used to for spherical tops such as ammonia or phosphine to assign the vibrational basis and eignefunctions with he vibrational index :math:`l`. Since typical basis sets used for these systems are 1D, they do not have this useful property and the ``lvib`` option could help recover it.


 - ``Postprocess`` (``post``): this option is used to postprocess the contracted vibrational basis set generated on a reduced potential or Hamiltonian for the full PEF. It helps improve the basis set by re-optimising it. For example, for the ``lvib``-constructed contracted basis functions, i.e. generated as eigenfunctions of :math:`\hat{l}^2`,  they can be post-processed by eigen-solving a reduced Hamiltonian to obtain a more efficient basis and keep :math:`l` as a quantum number. Example (from C\ :sub:`2` H\ :sub:`2`):
::

    BASIS
     0,'JKtau', jrot    0
     1,'numerov','linear',  'morse', range 0, 4, weight 2.0, points 2000, borders -0.3,0.6
     2,'numerov','linear',  'morse', range 0, 3, weight 1.0, points 1000, borders -0.5,0.75
     2,'numerov','linear',  'morse', range 0, 3, weight 1.0, points 1000, borders -0.5,0.75
     3,'harmonic','linear', 'linear',range 0, 6,r 2, weight 1.0, points 2000, borders -1.8,1.8  lvib post
     3,'harmonic','linear', 'linear',range 0, 6,r 2, weight 1.0, points 2000, borders -1.8,1.8  lvib post
     3,'harmonic','linear', 'linear',range 0, 6,r 2, weight 1.0, points 2000, borders -1.8,1.8  lvib post
     3,'harmonic','linear', 'linear',range 0, 6,r 2, weight 1.0, points 2000, borders -1.8,1.8  lvib post
    END

Here, the ``harmonic`` basis set was used for the sub-group 4 combing four linearised bending degrees of freedom of C\ :sub:`2` H\ :sub:`2` as the basis for eigen-solving for the vibrational angular momentum :math:`\hat{l}^2` (``lvib``). After the new wavefunctions are obtained as classified by :math:`l`, they are re-optimised (``post``) for the given :math:`l` by solving an eigenvalue problem for a reduced 4D Hamiltonian with a  quadratic PEF (``r 2``).


 - ``Nocheck`` is used to suppress checking of the symmetry equivalence of the modes within the same sub-group. This is necessary for the modes which are dynamically symmetry equivalent. For example, when treating molecule CH\ :sub:`3` OH can be treat a C\ :subs`3v` (M) molecule, the individual stretching CH modes   are not equivalent at any fixed torsional configuration and would nt be allowed in TROVE to be used for generating the basis sets. Instead, TROVE would choose the 1st mode at some reference torsional angle to generate a reference basis set and will used it for all three modes. For example:
 ::

    3, 'numerov', 'linear', 'morse', range  0, 4 , weight 1.0,points 1000,borders -0.4,  2.23 nocheck
    3, 'numerov', 'linear', 'morse', range  0, 4 , weight 1.0,points 1000,borders -0.4,  2.23 nocheck
    3, 'numerov', 'linear', 'morse', range  0, 4 , weight 1.0,points 1000,borders -0.4,  2.23 nocheck
